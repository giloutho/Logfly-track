## Logfly-track

This program is a study for the transposition of Logfly, developed with Electron, into a pure web application.

For the moment, the development only concerns the visualisation of GPS tracks.

We're trying to use the same modules in both projects. And as far as possible to offer the same interface (Bootstrap)

**This is not a functional program**, just an implementation test with Express

## Structure Project

The project is based on the use of Node.js, Express, EJS and Bootstrap.

The project architecture was designed using [up-routing-node.js-express-ejs](https://github.com/napthees/up-routing-node.js-express-ejs). Many thanks to the author : [Naphtees](https://github.com/napthees).

The files tree is built to resemble the Logfly Electron files tree as closely as possible

## Install and Start

 To install the packages

```
    npm install
```
 To start the application with node
 ```
    node start
 ```
It will be available from your browser at localhost:8080
